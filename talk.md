# Emergent Compassion: Designing AI and Education for Systems that Flourish

**Blaine Booher**  
Faith, Reason, and World Affairs Symposium  
Concordia College — Moorhead, Minnesota, 2025

---

<!-- _class: track-intro -->
## About Me
- Software Engineer (University of Cincinnati)
- Educator in Workforce Development
- I work with web, system design, AI, hardware
- I love natural systems, emergent behavior, human experience
- The more I seek to understand myself, the stranger it gets

---

<!-- _class: track-intro -->
## About this talk
- How I use AI as a lever of the mind
- Reflections on AI + education
- Non-dualism and Me (Thinking Mind, Meditation)
- Reflections on AI + systemic thinking

---

<!-- _class: track-intro -->
## The Current View: How I Use AI
- I tinker, iterate, find boundaries, jailbreak, dream together  
- I use AI as a **thinking tool**:  
  - *Discovery* — exploring, translating, frameworks  
  - *Learning* — researching, comparisons, codebase queries  
  - *Assistant* — debugging, testing, docs, boilerplate  
  - *Engineering* — refactoring, code generation  
- Software Engineers are natural automators

<!-- _class: track-intro -->
## Examples
- **Personal productivity:** trip planner, packing list  
- **Creative exploration:** music trivia, Dune battler, DJ app  
- **Education tools:** sight word app, mock interviews, flashcards  

Examples: Dune Battler, Sight Words, Homework Grader

## What I’ve Noticed
- AI feels like a reflection - of me, of us, our culture  
- Sometimes dumb/dangerous, sometimes profound  
- Like a giant search engine of all human knowledge  
- When used well → lever of the mind
- When used poorly → distorts reality
- In some cases, under my instruction, AI becomes my *Thinking Mind*

## A note on compassion

### Compassion is the recognition of suffering and the desire to alleviate it

- ***Karuna*** - the wish for all beings to be free from suffering (Buddhism)
- ***Agape*** - selfless, unconditional love that seeks the good of others (Christianity)
- ***Systems Design*** - AI designed to recognize and respond to human suffering; prioritize care over competition

## Non-Dualism and "Me"
- Tolle writes: *“You are not your mind. You are the awareness behind thought.”*  
- Meditation: my thoughts aren’t me, I am not my *Thinking Mind*
- When set down: presence, compassion, love, clarity emerge

> Beyond ego and compulsive thought lies "awareness-presence" where compassion, love, and service naturally arise, guiding action toward the well-being of others.

---
<!-- _class: track-heart -->
## Ego, Suffering, and AI
- "Identification with thought creates suffering" (Tolle)
- The **ego-driven mind** thrives on fear, separation, and control — sources of suffering  
- Left unchecked, the Thinking Mind repeats fear, scarcity, and judgment — patterns AI could easily amplify  

**Reflection:** If ego-driven thought fuels suffering, how can we guide AI to mirror compassion rather than fear?

---

<!-- _class: track-heart -->
### Wait a second...
- AI as an external Thinking Mind
- If that's true: *how we train it to think matters at profound level*
  - Reflection of our values (good and bad)
  - Guidance for the future state of our systems
  - Take on our cognitive load
- The **ego-trained AI** would amplify fear, separation, and control  

**Reflection:** If AI learns from our ego, it risks spreading suffering. If it learns from compassion, it can seed flourishing systems.

## Beyond the Thinking Mind
> “Presence is when you are fully conscious of the Now, not lost in thought about past or future. It is the space in which true intelligence, creativity, and compassion arise.” — Eckhart Tolle

### What new possibilities emerge if we let AI manage the Thinking Mind while humans cultivate Presence?

---

<!-- _class: track-evidence -->
## Amplify Harm or Compound Compassion?
- What if instead we seed AI with compassion, cooperation, systems-thinking?
- Bias compounds subtly; why not amplify *positive emergence*?
- Kindness and acts of compassion ripple through communities

**Nipun Mehta's insight:** *“What would the world look like if we designed for generosity instead of assuming people want to maximize self-interest?”*

> Consumption -> Contribution; Transaction -> Trust; Isolation -> Community

---

<!-- _class: track-design -->
## Reflection on Education
- Education today trains our Thinking Mind for our economy
- AI Mind → frees humans for relational, creative, compassionate practice
- Education shifts from **fact-delivery to wisdom-cultivation** 
- Everyone benefits: Teachers, Students, Community

**Richard Davidson:** *"Kindness is simple, kindness is contagious"*

---
<!-- _class: track-design -->
## Key Takeaways: AI as our Thinking Mind
- Acts of kindness ripple through communities (Davidson, Mehta)
- We can train our systems to reflect compassion, not ego
- **Teachers:** freed up for presence, connection, and modeling compassion
- **Students:** direct beneficiaries of a new model
- **Education’s Shift:** 
  - Old: Training our Thinking Mind for labor market
  - New: Cultivating wisdom, compassion, and alignment of heart+mind

Reflection: If AI can hold our Thinking Mind, education must teach us to live from the heart; the future systems we build will directly mirror the compassion, presence, and values we cultivate today

## Brief intro to Emergent Behavior

- **Ant Colonies**  
- **Birds & Fish Organization**
- **Human Systems: Global Scale**

> *As John Holland wrote: “Complex adaptive systems exhibit emergence: coherent structures arise from the interactions of simple rules.”*

Reflection: What causes so many of our global systems to be so harmful?

---

<!-- _class: track-emerge -->
## A vision of the future: AI <-> Human cooperation

- It's Coming: AI agency in our global systems
- **competition, ego, scarcity** → emergent harm: bias, inequity, competition
- **compassion, cooperation, reflective practice** → emergent systems of care
- **Bias training toward compassion** - not ego, scarcity, exploitation
- **Designing for the flourishing of all life** - sustainability, regeneration, lessening harm

---
<!-- _class: track-emerge -->
## Emergent Systems of Compassion
- Can compassionate AI agents create new emergent behaviors?
- Can we build systems that sustain, flourish, regenerate by default?
- Humans as stewards of wisdom and actions of the heart: relationships, community, compassion, service
- Unwind systems of harm, design new systems of heart
---

<!-- _class: track-intro -->
## Interactive Small Groups (10 min)
- Prompt: *If AI handled the Thinking Mind, what role would you want humans to play in education and society?*  
- Reconvene + discuss 

---

<!-- _class: track-intro -->
## Closing
- We live in interdependent systems - human-made and natural  
- Emergent outcomes depend on local actions
- Question: will AI be another tool of ego, or help us create systems of compassion?  
- The choice is up to us
