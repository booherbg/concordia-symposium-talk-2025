# Emergent Compassion: Designing AI and Education for Systems that Flourish

**Blaine Booher**  
Faith, Reason, and World Affairs Symposium  
Concordia College — Moorhead, Minnesota, 2025

## About Me
- Software Engineer (University of Cincinnati)
- Educator in Workforce Development
- I work with web, system design, AI, hardware
- I love natural systems, emergent behavior, human experience
- The more I seek to understand myself, the stranger it gets

---

## About this talk
- How I use AI as a lever of the mind
- Reflections on AI + education
- Non-dualism and Me (Thinking Mind, Meditation)
- Reflections on AI + systemic thinking

---

## The Current View: How I Use AI
- I tinker, iterate, find boundaries, jailbreak, dream together  
- I use AI as a **thinking tool**:  
  - *Discovery* — exploring, translating, frameworks  
  - *Learning* — researching, comparisons, codebase queries  
  - *Assistant* — debugging, testing, docs, boilerplate  
  - *Engineering* — refactoring, code generation  
- Software Engineers are natural automators

---

## Examples (Condensed)
- **Personal productivity:** trip planner, packing list  
- **Creative exploration:** music trivia, Dune battler, DJ app  
- **Education tools:** sight word app, mock interviews, flashcards  

Examples: Dune Battler, Sight Words, Homework Grader

## What I’ve Noticed
- AI feels like a reflection - of me, of us, our culture  
- Sometimes dumb/dangerous, sometimes profound  
- Like a giant search engine of all human knowledge  
- When used well → lever of the mind
- When used poorly → distorts reality
- In some cases, under my instruction, AI becomes my *Thinking Mind*

---

## AI and Education
- If AI amplifies what we train it on:  
  - What happens if we train it on competition, ego, scarcity?
  - What if instead we seed compassion, cooperation, systems-thinking?
- Especially critical for education (tutors, translators, assistants)
- Bias compounds subtly; why not amplify *positive emergence*?

**Nipun Mehta's insight:** *“What would the world look like if we designed for generosity instead of assuming people want to maximize self-interest?”*

## A note on compassion

### Compassion is the recognition of suffering and the desire to alleviate it

- **Karuna** - the wish for all beings to be free from suffering (Buddhism)
- **Agape** - selfless, unconditional love that seeks the good of others (Christianity)
- **Systems Design** - AI designed to recognize and respond to human suffering; prioritize care over competition

---

## Non-Dualism and "Me"
- Tolle writes: *“You are not your mind. You are the awareness behind thought.”*  
- Meditation showed me: my thoughts aren’t me  
- My “Thinking Mind” can be set down — presence, compassion, love, clarity emerge  
- AI feels like an externalized Thinking Mind  
- If that’s true: *what do we want it to think **with**?*
- Question for reflection: if AI can take on our Thinking Mind, can humans reclaim space for presence and compassion?

---

## Reflection on Education
- Education today trains our Thinking Mind for the economy
- AI cognitive load → frees humans for relational, creative, compassionate practice
- Education shifts from **fact-delivery to wisdom-cultivation** 

**Richard Davidson:** *"Kindness is simple, kindness is contagious"*

---

## Brief intro to Emergent Behavior

- **Ant Colonies**  
- **Birds & Fish**  

> *As John Holland wrote: “Complex adaptive systems exhibit emergence: coherent structures arise from the interactions of simple rules.”*

---

## Why Training AI Becomes Critical

- **compassion, cooperation, reflective practice** → emergent systems of care

- **competition, ego, scarcity** → emergent harm: bias, inequity, competition

---

## Visions of AI <-> Human future
- AI Thinking Mind participating in our economic systems on our behalf
- Training **biased toward compassion** - not ego, scarcity, exploitation
- **Designing for the flourishing of all life** - sustainability, regeneration, lessening harm
- Dismantling systems of harm, enabling new emergent stable states that flourish
- Humans as stewards of wisdom and actions of the heart: relationships, community, compassion, service
---

## Interactive Small Groups (10 min)
- Prompt: *If AI handled the Thinking Mind, what role would you want humans to play in education and society?*  
- Reconvene + discuss 

## Closing
- We live in interdependent systems - human-made and natural  
- Emergent outcomes depend on local actions
- Question: will AI be another tool of ego, or help us create systems of compassion?  
- The choice is up to us
