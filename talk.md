# 🌍 AI, Education, and the Future of Compassion  
**Blaine Booher**  
Concordia College Symposium 2025  

---

## Opening  
I just returned from a Buddhist monastery in the redwoods.  
There, I discovered:  
- Meditation helps my ADHD in surprising ways.  
- Nondualism resonates as a model of reality.  
- Ego dissolution → compassion and connection.  

**Question:** What role might AI play in this unfolding story?  

---

## Frame for Today  
AI is rapidly reshaping education.  
But the key question isn’t *what AI can do*…  
It’s **what values we embed** into these systems.  

🌿 Optional layer:  
*Like waves that believe they are separate from the ocean, we sometimes mistake separateness. But learning — and AI — remind us of our interconnection.*

## AI in Education: What We Know  
- Adaptive tutoring systems personalize learning (Zawacki-Richter, 2019).  
- AI can assist grading, accessibility, and reflection.  
- Risks: bias, over-surveillance, inequity (UNESCO, 2021).  

**Takeaway:** AI amplifies values already present in education.  

---

## Opportunity  
- Free human teachers for **connection, mentorship, compassion**.  
- Support learners with **equity and accessibility**.  
- Build systems that reflect not only **knowledge**, but also **wisdom**.  

🌿 Optional reflection:  
AI can hold the “thinking mind” role → freeing humans to embody presence, empathy, and care.
