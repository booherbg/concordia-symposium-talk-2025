Emergent Compassion: Designing AI and Education for Systems that Flourish

Opening (10 min) – Tell your story. The monastery, ADHD + meditation, ego dissolution, and how that shifted your view of AI. This hooks people, makes you credible and vulnerable.

## About Me

## About this Talk
- How I use AI as a lever of the mind
- Reflections on AI and learning
- Non-dualism and Me (Thinking Mind, Meditation)
- Reflections on AI and systemic thinking

## The Current View: How I Use AI
- I tinker, iterate, find boundaries, jailbreak, dream together  
- I use AI as a **thinking tool**:  
  - *Discovery* — exploring, translating, frameworks  
  - *Learning* — researching, comparisons, codebase queries  
  - *Assistant* — debugging, testing, docs, boilerplate  
  - *Engineering* — refactoring, code generation  
- We’re lazy; we automate. :P

## Examples (Condensed)
- **Personal productivity:** trip planner, packing list  
- **Creative exploration:** music trivia, Dune battler, DJ app  
- **Education tools:** sight word app, mock interviews, flashcards  

Examples: Dune Battler, Sight Words, Homework Grader 

<!--

## What I’ve Noticed
- AI feels like a reflection—of us, society  
- Sometimes dumb/dangerous, sometimes profound  
- Like a giant search engine of all human knowledge  
- When used well → lever of the mind  
- When used poorly → distorts reality  
- In some cases, under my instruction, AI becomes my *Thinking Mind*  

<!-- 
The Provocation (15 min) – Ask: if AI is just an amplifier of what we train it on, what happens if we train it only on competition, ego, and scarcity? What if instead we seeded it with compassion, cooperation, and systems-thinking? Bring in references from complexity science, Buddhism, and maybe even contemplative pedagogy in education. -->

## AI and Education
- If AI amplifies what we train it on:  
  - What happens if we train it on competition, ego, scarcity?
  - What if instead we seed compassion, cooperation, systems-thinking?
- **Nipun Mehta's framework**: Design AI for generosity, not self-interest
- Especially critical for education (tutors, translators, assistants)
- Bias compounds subtly; why not amplify *positive emergence*?

<!-- 
## AI in Education (Cautionary Reflection)
- As we use these tools, they become amplifiers of what we train them on. What happens when we train them on sources of competition, ego, and scarcity?
- What happens if we instead seed them with examples of compassion, cooperation, and systems-thinking?
- This becomes especially important as we look at AI as tutors, as research assistants, as translators, as assistants.
- Bias compounds and is often subtle or hidden. We have these amazing tools, why not increase the chances of emergent positive outcomes for students and all users? -->

## Non-Dualism and Me
- Tolle writes: *“You are not your mind. You are the awareness behind thought.”*  
- Meditation showed me: my thoughts aren’t me  
- My “Thinking Mind” can be set down — presence, compassion, love, clarity emerge  
- AI feels like an externalized Thinking Mind  
- If that’s true: *what do we want it to think **with**?*
- Question for reflection: if AI can take on our Thinking Mind, can humans reclaim space for presence and compassion?

<!-- ### Insights from *The Power of Now* (Tolle, 1997) -->
<!-- - The ego thrives on identification with thought; liberation comes from disidentifying.   -->
<!-- - When the mind quiets, we access a deeper seat of consciousness — presence, compassion, love.   -->
<!-- - This frames my experience: meditation showed me I am not bound to constant problem-solving.   -->


<!-- # Non-Dualism and Me
- Over the past few years I've been on a journey to understand more about my mind
- Pro: massive color and dopamine when problem solving, creatively connecting ideas, learning, focusing
- Con: underestimate my limits (physical, mental)
- It is easy to get so wrapped up into these machinations of the mind that we believe that we ARE our thoughts
- Our mind convinces us that this must be true, our value is based on our ability to produce, compete, accolades


## My experience with meditation
- I was a volunteer a retreat hosted in a non-religious context at a budhist retreat
- We discussed consciousness, connectedness, kindness, service, artificial intelligence, and systemic thinking
- Meditation, silence, quiet patience showed me it was possible to turn my Thinking Mind off
- If this is possible, it means that I am not my Thinking Mind
- While the go and thinking mind protect us from the world, Eckart Tolle tells us that Compassion, Love, and Empathy eminate from the seat of consciousness (Genuine Self) that lives behind the thoughts

### Evidence from Human Learning

- Neuroscientist **Richard Davidson** found that  
  even **5 minutes of daily well-being practice**  
  reduced teacher burnout and improved classroom climate.  

- Kindness is **contagious**:  
  what we practice as individuals shapes those around us.

The Vision (10 min) – Paint a picture of AI as a “thinking partner” that takes on cognitive load so humans can invest in relational, creative, compassionate practices. Education shifts from fact-delivery to wisdom-cultivation.

# A Brief Reflection on Education
- A large part of our education is training our mind for the real world, especially as it comes to workforce development, practical skills, and preparation for entering the labor market
- I would argue that a central tenant of this training is specifically designed to sharpen our Thinking Mind for participation in the economic systems that we depend on (for *money*, job, wealth creation, etc).

## AI in the Workforce
- Can AI take on the cognative load in the work force? What if we outsource our Thinking Mind?
- Imagine freeing our collective cognative load so that humans can invest in relational, creative, compassionate practices.
- Imagine AI agents participating in our economic engines with biases *toward* compassion, cooperation, and system thinking - without the trappings of human ego, scarcity mindset, and exploitative competition?
- Can we shift Education from fact-delivery to wisdom-cultivation?
- What if our current institutions and economic models, through intentional and compassionate AI participation, can be migrated from systems of harm and exploitation to systems that by default are sustainable and support the flourishing of all life? What would this do to our species, our culture, our planet and all life that depends on it, including us?
-->

## The Vision (10 min)
- Education today trains the Thinking Mind for the economy
- If AI carries our Thinking Mind, patterns we train it on become system-level behaviors  
    - Seed AI with **compassion, cooperation, reflective practice** → emergent systems of care  
    - Neglect values → emergent harm: bias, inequity, competition  
- Free humans for relational, creative, compassionate practice  
- Imagine AI in economic engines **biased toward compassion** - not ego, scarcity, exploitation  
- Education shifts from **fact-delivery to wisdom-cultivation**  

**Nipun Mehta's insight (TEDxFargo):** *"What would the world look like if we designed for generosity instead of assuming people want to maximize self-interest?"*

## Interactive Small Groups (10 min)
- Prompt: *If AI handled the Thinking Mind, what role would you want humans to play in education and society?*  
- Reconvene + discuss 

## Closing (5 min)
- We live in interdependent systems—human-made and natural  
- Emergent outcomes depend on local actions  
- Question: will AI be another tool of ego, or help us create systems of compassion?  
- The choice is up to us

<!-- 
## Closing
- We live in a world of interdependence and global systems, both human made and natural. These systems have emergent behaviors that are the result of individual actions at the local level. We are faced with a choice: Will this crop of AI be just another tool of ego, or can it help us create new emergent educational and economic systems of compassion? The choice is up to us. 

Closing (5 min) – Return to your core question, leave it open, tie back to faith and tradition: AI can be just another tool of ego, or it can help us create emergent systems of compassion. The choice is collective. -->

Open Questions:
    - How to bring in Nipun's talks
    - How to bring in Richard's talks on education
    - Sources for compounding bias?
    - Should we talk about complex adaptive systems?

Actions:
    - x Run this back through gpt5 for feedback, see how we can tighten this up
    - Move this to google slides, but keep it simple
    - Review the original thesis, consider tying to a more rigid understanding of education, compassion, etc.
    - Review the teachings of the retreat, evaluate for buddhism
    - x Confirm non-dualism understandings
